# Product

I have built a backend application with spring boot and POSTGRESQL database. In this application I have developed various api's such as upload a file which has all the details
of the various products (E-commerce type). After that the file will be stored on the server and all the product items which are present in the file will be stored in the database.
I am also storing the file metadata in database.After that build api's which can query on the basis of product name, id, category or delete specific product or file from database as well as delete file from server.

Also developed an api which can download all the products in an xlsx file. I tried to make the application modular, extensible and readable by following SOLID design prniciples.

TECHNOLOGIES USED: JAVA, SPRING BOOT, POSTGRESQL, POSTMAN.
